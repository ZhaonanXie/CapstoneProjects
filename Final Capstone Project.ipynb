    "The number of Chinese restaurants in Dublin is relatively small. There might be potential benefits if it opens.\n",
    "Therefore, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Chinese restaurant in Dublin, Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in Dublin we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Chinese restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the selection of the locations is assumed to be highly dependent on its nearby environment instead of the economic factors such as rental prince.\n",
    "The main task would be to select the 5 possible locations to open the cinema and explain them to stakeholders.\n"
